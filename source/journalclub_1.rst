Journal club 1: Principles of data visualization
************************************************

We read and discuss the article `"Principles of effective data visualization" by Stephen R. Midway <https://www.cell.com/patterns/fulltext/S2666-3899(20)30189-6>`_, which gives us an overview of the most important principles to consider when visualizing data.
Now, we are equipped with the theoretical knowledge to create reasonable visualizations.
We will first apply this knowledge while learning how to actually implement such visualizations using the Python programming language.
