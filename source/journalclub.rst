Throughout the course, we will discuss various articles from the field of data analysis.

We start with `"Principles of effective datavisualization" by Stephen R. Midway <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.patter.2020.100141>`_, which gives us an overview of the most important principles to consider when visualizing data.

Next, we will discuss the pitfalls of determining whether an observation should be considered significant or not.
For this purpose, we will read and discuss `"The fickle P value generates irreproducible results" by Halsey et al. <https://doi.org/10.1038/nmeth.3288>`_.
